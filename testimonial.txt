                    During my time at Microsoft, I relied on Sanjay and his
                    team's enablement sessions for several years. As a Technical
                    Specialist, Sanjay's content was key to enabling the
                    thousands of global technical field resources on how to tell
                    customer relatable stories to solve business challenges. As
                    a Data & AI seller in the field, I continued to rely on
                    Sanjayâ€™s team enablement sessions, including his Industry
                    specific demos and POC accelerators.

                    as a WW Tech Lead in Data on WW field enablement. It's easy
                    to call someone a hardworking individual, but Sanjay truly
                    outshines most people I've worked with in that regard. The
                    collaboration we had on creating enablement assets (e.g.
                    events, conferences, and deployable technical/industry
                    demos) had a positive impact on thousands of technical field
                    sellers around the world.

                    Sanjay is awesome to work and I especially admire the
                    positive energy he brings to everything he does. Sanjay has
                    an immense passion for storytelling which he brings to all
                    the DREAM demos he's built for the field in areas of
                    Finance, Health, Manufacturing, Retail, and more! He also
                    runs creative skilling events, enablement, and readiness
                    events that make my job as a field seller much easier.
